Direct Script Tag
For the fastest integration, simply drop this tag into the <head> of your HTML:

HTML

<script async src="path/to/analytics.js"></script>
📖 Usage
Initializing the Pulse Tracker
Once the script is loaded, you can access the powerful bridge functions (google_tag_data.glBridge) to manage your tracking!

JavaScript

// Register a custom function to run on every link click/form submission
google_tag_data.glBridge.auto(
  function() {
    return { 'client_id': '12345' };
  }, 
  ['example.com', 'mydomain.net'], 
  'query', 
  true
);

// Get any decorated parameters from the URL
const params = google_tag_data.glBridge.get(true); 
console.log('Pulse Parameters:', params);
